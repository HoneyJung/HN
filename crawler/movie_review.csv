0,High on Films,"June 5, 2020",Anton Bitel,"under the guise of an engaging, thrilling, rip-roaring piece of entertainment..., Bong has delivered a spectacular deconstruction of the late-capitalist society in which we all must live together - if not all on the same level."
1,Nightmarish Conjurings,"May 20, 2020",Shikhar Verma,"Settling in for a narrative about a family trying to keep it together by overpowering the capitalistic battle, Bong Joon-ho has constructed a low-key tragic comedy that insists on being more than just that."
2,Cinetopia,"May 11, 2020",Sarah Musnicky,PARASITE is Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece.
3,Uncut Magazine [UK],"May 9, 2020",Jim Ross,"It's very rare a film makes a step-change in what is going on and the dynamics of the characters, and makes that work as well it does here."
4,Cinemaphile.org,"May 1, 2020",Damon Wise,"...director Bong is also working on other levels, not only making all of its characters relatable - the Parks are really quite sweet people, if a little lacking in self-awareness - but telling his story with a healthy dose of uproarious slapstick."
5,Casey's Movie Mania,"April 23, 2020",David Keyes,"A picture that audaciously devours the force of convention and transforms it into a feverish undercurrent, driving what can only be described as an engine through the odyssey of mayhem."
6,ReelTalk Movie Reviews,"April 14, 2020",Casey Chong,"Kudos go to Bong's sleight-of-hand narrative approach, as he seamlessly defying genres by alternating from drama to comedy to thriller and back again over the course of its 131-minute running time."
7,Bowling Green Daily News,"April 13, 2020",Betty Jo Tucker,"'Parasite' includes some wish-I-never-saw-that scenes. Viewers who are faint of heart should be forewarned, but horror fans might enjoy the carnage."
8,The Daily Beast,"April 9, 2020",Micheal Compton,A film that is genre-defying and free of the restraints of conventional storytelling.
9,My Champlain Valley,"April 4, 2020",Laura Bradley,"With each passing day, Bong Joon-ho's class-conscious thriller about a family that lives in a sub-basement-and the blissfully naïve rich family they wind up working for-becomes even more prescient."
10,Discussing Film,"March 9, 2020",Julia Swift,"Get ready for thrills and laughter. As the credits roll, all the layers of meaning in every shot, character and object become clear and you can't wait to spread the word. This is what cinema does best -- entertain, provoke, create discussion."
11,Mama's Geeky,"March 5, 2020",Ben Rolph,"Everything is superbly controlled and nailed to the point at which you begin to question, how is this possible?"
12,Cineaste Magazine,"February 26, 2020",Tessa Smith,"Parasite surprised me over and over. I constantly had no idea what was going to happen next. But what did happen, was amazing and extremely well done."
13,Mad About Movies Podcast,"February 25, 2020",Robert Koehler,"When the history of this moment in world cinema is written, Parasite will take its place as the movie that got the moment right."
14,Hyperallergic,"February 25, 2020",Brian Gill,"A monumental achievement in film and the rare film that goes from ""very good"" to ""historically great"" in its final act."
15,Film Ireland Magazine,"February 24, 2020",Dan Schindel,"The smartest mainstream film about class made in many years, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite lays bare the lie that hard work can bring anyone closer to their dreams."

21,Monocle,"February 19, 2020",Jaby Koay,The acting's amazing.
22,Monocle,"February 14, 2020",Tim Robey,I think it's a career peak for [Bong Joon-ho].
23,Another Gaze,"February 14, 2020",Simran Hans,Watching that drama -- the bricks sort of build and then topple -- is so satisfying.
24,ComicBook Debate,"February 14, 2020",Rebecca Liu,"Thinking very metaphorically may not lead to our salvation, but the consciousness it induces just might."

33,Unilad,"February 11, 2020",Sucharita Tyagi,"What's to be said about this film that hasn't already been said? ... because there is so much to take in, like a Da Vinci painting, the film reveals secrets and hidden meanings until you're left breathless..."
34,Liquid Marmalade,"February 11, 2020",Cameron Frew,Cinema of the highest form. No headline will ever convey the power of Parasite - it's a masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed.
35,tonymacklin.net,"February 11, 2020",Rosalynn Try-Hane,"What makes Parasite such a good film is that it tells a story first and foremost, so the social commentary whilst ever present isn't so overpowering that you cannot just enjoy the story being told."
36,Playboy Online,"February 11, 2020",Tony Macklin,The parasites have parasites.
37,The Mail on Sunday (UK),"February 11, 2020",Stephen Rebello,"Ingeniously written and directed, plus faultlessly acted, this is one of the great movie experiences of this or any year."

39,The Ooh Tray,"February 10, 2020",Tom Shone,"Plugging into our universal disquiet about the inequality between the haves and have-nots, Bong has fashioned a darkly enjoyable class-war thriller in which the real monster is global capitalism itself, but there is nothing heady or didactic about it."
40,We Have a Hulk,"February 9, 2020",Ed Whitfield,"One's left to wonder who's parasitically living off whom? The Kims off the Parks, or the Americans off their anti-communist allies?"

43,The Hindu,"February 9, 2020",Kevin Wight,"This serpentine, unclassifiable piece stands as a highlight among the director's already glittering career."
44,The Arts Desk,"February 8, 2020",Namrata Joshi,"Far from hiding, the film's beguiling charm stokes the deeply dystopian vision of its maker. In Bong's world, despite tokens like a cell phone or pizza dinners, social mobility doesn't quite exist."
45,Kermode & Mayo's Film Review,"February 7, 2020",Demetrios Matheou,"[I]ts delivery - mixing social satire, twisty plotting and Hitchcockian tension - a masterclass in serious-minded but accessible mainstream filmmaking."
46,Scotsman,"February 7, 2020",Mark Kermode,I think this film is as close to perfect as anything I have seen in the last 10 years. It's just fantastic.
47,The Big Issue,"February 7, 2020",Alistair Harkness,[A]s a filmmaker [Bong's] less interested in finger-wagging admonishments than he is in taking us to uncomfortable places with outré plot twists that deepen and reframe what we think we know about the characters.
48,Christianity Today,"February 7, 2020",Cath Clarke,"Using industrial-strength social satire, [Bong Joon Ho] strips the veneer off the myth of classlessness, giving an outrageously entertaining instant classic."
49,The Spectator,"February 7, 2020",Jennifer Clark,"While Parasite has won critical acclaim worldwide, seeming to strike a chord with audiences for its raw class commentary, the movie's message is not clear cut. It's a dark comedy, but by the end you're not sure if the joke is on you after all."
50,CineVue,"February 7, 2020",Deborah Ross,"It works on every level which is, perhaps, fitting for a film about levels and whether you are at the top or bottom in life."
51,New Statesman,"February 5, 2020",Tom Duggins,"Parasite is quite simply a supreme feat of film-making, a tense and hilarious jewel box of a film that draws you deeper and deeper into its wicked, absurdist satire."
52,Newsday,"February 5, 2020",Ryan Gilbey,"Parasite works as entertainment and analysis, treat and treatise."
53,The Digital Fix,"February 5, 2020",Rafer Guzman,An imaginative comedy-thriller with darkness at its core.
54,Metro (UK),"February 5, 2020",Steven Sheehan,The word masterpiece is often too easily used... But you can easily understand why Parasite has been given that label by so many because finding a reason to disagree feels just as redundant.
55,Financial Times,"February 5, 2020",Larushka Ivan-Zadeh,"Though we largely root for the Kims, Bong doesn't allow anything as simple as rich versus poor, good versus bad. No wonder this movie speaks to global audiences - it's a parable about our capitalist world."
56,Daily Mirror (UK),"February 5, 2020",Danny Leigh,"A film that always has two thoughts in its head at once, a spectacular epic and tightly wound chamber piece, chicly sophisticated, brutal as a hammer."
57,Empire Magazine,"February 3, 2020",Richard Bonaduce,"It takes a while to get there, but it sticks its landing."
58,Otroscines.com,"February 3, 2020",John Nugent,A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic.
59,Arré,"February 1, 2020",Manu Yáñez,Bong builds the rocambolesque plot of Parasite from a solid architectural skeleton. [Full Review in Spanish]
60,Midwest Film Journal,"January 31, 2020",Poulomi Das,"It's a gripping, existential, horrifying study of a nightmarish world - except that it is true."
61,EscribiendoCine,"January 31, 2020",Nick Rogers,"We see what we want. We want what we see. Woe unto the collateral damage we leave. There may be no more original schemes, but the best movie of 2019 is more fascinated by original sins and the shapes they take in the here and now."
62,The Maine Edge,"January 31, 2020",Fernando E. Juan Lima,"Intrigue, violence, gore and humor show us a Korea in which not everything that shines is gold. [Full review in Spanish]"
63,Book & Film Globe,"January 30, 2020",Allen Adams,"Parasite is staggeringly good, a remarkable piece of filmmaking that immerses and unnerves. Bong Joon Ho's direction is that of a maestro, of an auteur unleashed."
64,Daily Mirror (UK),"January 29, 2020",Neal Pollack,"A masterful genre chronicle of savage injustice and a master-class in genre filmmaking from Bong Joon-ho, Parasite is a classic must-see for anyone who loves film."
65,Hindustan Times,"January 29, 2020",Lewis Knight,"Quite simply put, Parasite is a thrilling masterpiece from Bong Joon-ho, a director at the height of his powers offering a film that is profoundly entertaining, wonderfully realised, and thought-provoking."
66,Dog and Wolf,"January 29, 2020",Rohan Naahar,"In Parasite, Bong doesn't appear to be expressing empathy for the poor. Nor does he seem to be pointing fingers at the rich. He is, instead, questioning the very nature of mankind; its self-centred ingratitude and its propensity to create divisions."
67,Digital Spy,"January 28, 2020",Alexa Dalby,It really is a must-see.
68,Flick Feast,"January 28, 2020",Ian Sandwell,"Very few movies in recent years have left you unsure what's going to happen next, but even when you do, it's still a compelling watch. Quite simply, Parasite is a masterpiece."
69,THN,"January 27, 2020",Katie Smith-Wong,"Stunning and intricate, it is simply brilliant."
70,Laramie Movie Scope,"January 27, 2020",Kat Hughes,"A deep and complex narrative, rich in social commentary, is intricately wrapped within layer upon layer of different complementary genres and tones."
71,La Nación (Argentina),"January 24, 2020",Robert Roten,"It plays like a brilliant con job comedy in the first half, before switching to total wacko mode at the end, with knives out and bloody. I liked the first half of this Jekyll and Hyde film a lot. The second half, not so much."
72,Konexión,"January 23, 2020",Marcelo Stiletano,"Bong Joon-Ho here constructs a powerful and intense hybrid of genres, themes, and observations that grow and acquire sense as the story, which is full of rich details, unfolds. [Full Review in Spanish]"

78,RTÉ (Ireland),"January 16, 2020",Lapacazo Sandoval,Bong builds the smallest moments into something monumental.
79,MovieCrypt.com,"January 13, 2020",Paddy Kehoe,"No doubt Asian capitalist interests are well-served in the end, there won't be rioting in the streets on the back of this one. A film is hardly effective satire if it doesn't point up a route to radical change."
80,Lyles' Movie Files,"January 13, 2020",Kevin A. Ranson,... playful until it becomes diabolical... only then does (writer/director) Bong Joon Ho show exactly the cards he's holding.
81,jackiekcooper.com,"January 10, 2020",Jeffrey Lyles,The only real question is how high you'll rank it in your top films of 2019 or the 2010s decade list.
82,Every Movie Has a Lesson,"January 8, 2020",Jackie K. Cooper,"Unexpected, quirky, funny, horrific, dramatic - all of these things, but also just a bit tedious in parts. Not your average movie for sure."

84,Den of Geek,"January 4, 2020",Michael Ward,Parasite deserves to take its rightful place as one of the decade's finest films.

90,Cine Premiere,"December 27, 2019",Hugo Hernández Valdivia,"Parasite makes us see a landscape of injustice that we normally don't want to see. It feels uncomfortable, but it offers us plenty of material for reflection. Bravo! [Full Review in Spanish]"
91,En Filme,"December 27, 2019",Arturo Magaña,Bong Joon-ho succeeds in showing us that the worst monster of our reality is the system that we have built. [Full Review in Spanish]
92,Q Network Film Desk,"December 27, 2019",Luis Fernando Galván,"Bong is crude, direct, ruthless, and at the same time refined. The director doesn't deliver a moralizing discourse. On the contrary, he offers a crescendo where suspense and the grotesque come together. [Full Review in Spanish]"
93,El Universal,"December 27, 2019",James Kendrick,"an elaborate thriller that at first seems to pit the have's against the have-not's, but is ultimately about how the have not's are forced to turn against each other in the mad clamor for whatever dwindling social and economic crumbs they can find"
94,TheArtsStl,"December 26, 2019",Alonso Díaz de la Vega,We are before a remarkable degree of narrative skill. [Full review in Spanish]
95,CineXpress,"December 26, 2019",Phil Guie,"Just when we think we know where the narrative is headed, Bong pulls the rug out from under us via turns that are occasionally dazzling, yet always organic, thanks to meticulous foreshadowing and his knack for slowly building an atmosphere of dread."
96,The Muse/Jezebel,"December 25, 2019",Fico Cangiano,Bong Joon-ho delivers something really special: the best film of 2019. [Full review in Spanish]
97,Eye for Film,"December 23, 2019",Rich Juzwiak,"Parasite was too on the nose too often for me to give it my full heart. However, I loved an ambiguity at its core..."

100,The Tyee (British Columbia),"December 19, 2019",Jorge Rivera Rubio,"The conversation about the gap between social classes is cynical, fun, and exasperating, because Bong doesn't simply talks about rich versus poor, but things that few people dare to talk about. [Full review in Spanish]"
101,Paul's Trip to the Movies,"December 18, 2019",Dorothy Woodend,"I haven't seen another film that pinned down the essence of the year, wriggling and squirming, with such eviscerating precision. It's not just a film; it's a vivisection."
102,Concrete Playground,"December 18, 2019",Paul McGuire Grimes,The only thing that you should expect is the unexpected.
103,Film Inquiry,"December 18, 2019",Sarah Ward,"This isn't just a killer picture on all of the standard levels, however. Contemplating society's growing class collisions and inequities, Parasite also makes a killer statement."
104,Dare Daniel,"December 18, 2019",Wilson Kwong,"Parasite is cinema at its very best, and will continue to be lauded as a timeless masterpiece."

106,Entertainment Weekly,"December 18, 2019",Frantz Jerome,Parasite is a well-designed kick down the stairs that you cannot see coming. Rarely does a movie take you on the kind of trip this one does.
107,NPR,"December 11, 2019",Leah Greenblatt,"If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it too."
108,Collider,"December 11, 2019",Bob Mondello,"Let's just say that by ""Parasite's"" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet."
109,L.A. Weekly,"December 11, 2019",Gregory Ellwood,"Obviously, these are not new themes or issues unheard of within the global economy, but it's not often a filmmaker finds a way to portray it in such unique shades of grey."
110,Houston Press,"December 11, 2019",Nathaniel Bell,"Even if its social message about culture and class (Alfred-Hitchcock-by-way-of-Karl-Marx) is laid on too thick in the end, this Parasite slithers most agreeably."
111,Salon.com,"December 11, 2019",Pete Vonder Haar,Parasite is a triumph by a director who still hasn't really made a misstep.
112,Asian Movie Pulse,"December 11, 2019",Andrew O'Hehir,"It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way."

115,The Ringer,"December 11, 2019",Mel Campbell,"Impeccable, sustaining shocking plot twists and tonal shifts between suspense, poignant family drama and slapstick farce without ever sacrificing its visual flair and impudent sense of humour."
116,Escapist Magazine,"December 9, 2019",Sean Fennessey,"This movie is scary and funny and utterly beguiling. If you haven't seen it, you must."
117,Gayly Dreadful,"December 9, 2019",Bob Chipman,"Has other, more interesting, uncomfortable things on it's mind - and the most uncomfortable of all is [when] you start to realize none of these people are as bad as you want them to be."
118,The American Conservative,"December 6, 2019",Terry Mesnard,Parasite is a mature and complex examination of the cyclical nature of the haves and have-notes. It's probably the best film I've seen this year.
119,REELYDOPE,"December 5, 2019",Eve Tushnet,"This is a movie about messages, codes and plans, subterranean communications and misperceptions. Parasite may even be a ""message movie,"" though it has an artistry that term conceals."
120,Newport This Week (RI),"December 4, 2019",Malik Adán,Parasite ups the ante by presenting the (sometimes literal) moral depths of the dream of class mobility.
121,CBC News Network,"December 2, 2019",Loren King,"Bong drags human greed and its consequences into the light with his lacerating wit, unabashed brutality and heart-wrenching tragedy, turning ""Parasite"" into an audacious and explosive parable for our times."

123,Battle Royale With Cheese,"November 28, 2019",Amanda Mazzillo,"Parasite is a well-made, engaging, and memorable film exploring class disparity in Korea. With its darkly comedic tone, Parasite manages to entertain, while crafting a surprising and socially relevant experience."
124,Medium Popcorn,"November 27, 2019",Nick Boyd,"While the off-beat nature of the narrative surely will not appeal to everyone, those with a desire to be taken on a thrilling ride of many twists and turns will be rewarded with an unpredictable and unsettling sharp class dissection."

126,Fiction Machine,"November 26, 2019",Brandon Collins,"I tried to predict what was happening, and I was wrong every time. I like that...the acting was a bit different, and it took some time to get up to speed, but I really enjoyed it."
127,Tony Baker Comedy,"November 26, 2019",Grant Watson,"It is a difficult task to review films like Parasite, because in the end you have almost certainly run out of superlatives with which to apply to it."

130,The Christian Century,"November 22, 2019",Chris McCoy,Parasite is at once a comedy and a Hitchcockian thriller with shades of mid-period Cohen Bros thrown in for good ironic measure. This film is a solid must-see for anyone who values quality filmmaking with something to say.

134,Asheville Movies,"November 20, 2019",John Anderson,"It is a sitcom with teeth and haunting moral echoes, no small amount of vulgarity and a smart streak of comedy."
135,We Bought a Blog,"November 20, 2019",Edwin Arnaudin,Bong packs his frames with visual symbolism that speaks to contemporary times and writes characters on both sides of the economic divide that feel relatable and well-rounded.
